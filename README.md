# js-counter-with-closures


Implement a very simple (increment/decrement) counter application(without using global variable) with the help of html css and js. In UI, There should have two button called Increment and Decrement and their work is to increment or decrement the count value by 1 accordingly. You can declare any variable in globally except the initial count value. ( Don't care about UI design. Focus on your required logic. )
